An ASP.NET MVC React app to keep track of all my job application rejections.
Skills and Tools used: C#/.NET, ASP.NET, MVC, React, Linq, EFCore

I'm going to have to rethink this, I think I might have to go back to Razor Pages. 
I just keep running in to HTTP errors, and I think the only way to fix it is to start
over because I don't have enough experience fixing these kinds of issues.
