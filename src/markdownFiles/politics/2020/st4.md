ST4 needs a new Link Light Rail line that hits the other side of South King County.
A line that goes from Seattle to Tukwila Transit Center, Kent Transit Center, Auburn Transit
Center, and then go off to the Muckleshoot Reservation and then Enumclaw. 

The Sounder offers too little coverage, with just some commuter times in the early 
morning and evening. 

Buses are just too slow to be practical for longer distance trips,
they can easily turn a short drive to an hours long affair. 

Of course this would be a stepping stone to get the entire state access to Light Rail
and get more people access to affordable transportation and mobility.
