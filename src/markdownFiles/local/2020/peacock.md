Update November 27, 2020: He is back home with his owner, and out of the cold.

Update November 5, 2020: I haven't seen him in a while, hopefully he's not in
 the rain.

Update October 27, 2020: Hopefully he's found somewhere warm to hang out during
the cold weather, I don't think peacocks are cold weather birds.

Update October 15, 2020: He's been taking shelter on my porch, during the winds.

Update October 2, 2020: He's still around and can leap over most fences.

Update September 8, 2020: He was in my backyard, I don't know how he got in there
because it is completely fenced off.

Update September 3, 2020: He was in my yard earlier, and seems to be doing well.

Update September 1, 2020: Still haven't seen or heard of the peacock for a while.

Update: I haven't seen it in a while.

Update: It's still running around, I hope it's safe and eating well. 

There is a Peacock running around my Neighborhood.
